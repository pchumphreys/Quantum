    "# Quantum information protocols with NV centres\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of the main steps in QI protocols using NV centres:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial off-resonance optical pulse is used to prepare the ground state spin via optical spin-polarisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed by the application of static and microwave fields to manipulate the spin (and potentially radio frequency fields to manipulate coupled nuclear spins) and a period to allow the NV to interact with other spins and evolve. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Readout\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an off-resonance optical pulse is used to readout the ground state spin by mea- suring the integrated Stokes shifted fluorescence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that this mode of operation relies upon the performance of the optical spin-polarisation and readout mechanisms, which are currently only crudely understood. Indeed, the degree of ground state optical spin-polarisation is not consistently reported in the literature, with many different values ranging from 42-96% reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ground state spin-polarisation represents the preparation fidelity of the qubit, it is vital to the operation of the qubit that it is well characterised. However, to date there has been no systematic study of spin-polarisation and its variation with applied electromagnetic fields, strain, and temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, there have been reports of readout enhancement techniques using hyperfine coupling with N and 13C nuclear spins, however it is quite possible that a fully developed understanding of the optical readout mechanism will provide alternate means to enhance readout more significantly. "

    "\n",
    "Resonant excitation can easily suppress emission of the negatively charged NV defect, transferring it to a long living dark state. The rate at which laser excitation\n",
    "transfers the NV center into the dark state is well fitted by a quadratic function of the laser power. This is thought to be due to a two photon process in which one photon excites the 3E state while the second photon transfers the electron to the conduction band of the diamond host material. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally an off-resonant shorter wavelength laser (532 nm) is used to restore NV\u0001 emission after bleaching by resonant excitation. However, this results in an unwanted side effect—spectral shift of the NV\u0001 transitions. High power (a few milliwatts) 532 nm laser pulses can excite many closely situated impurities and thereby drastically change the surrounding charge distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral stability of NV\u0001 is improved when repumping is done at the ZPL of NV0, since the less energetic and lower intensity yellow laser has lesser impact on the system. A more than fourfold enhancement of the NV\u0001 spectral stability is achieved in the method exploiting repumping at ZPL of NV0.\n",

    "### Delft protocol \n",

    "> We verify charge and resonance condition by applying laser pulses on Ey and E1,2 simultaneously and putting a lower threshold on the number of phonon side band photons detected during those pulses. If the threshold is not met we reset\n",
    "the charge state: On Alice, we repump NV0 → NV− using a laser at 575 nm, on resonance with the ZPL of NV0. On Bob, we use off-resonant excitation at 532 nm. We repeat verification and repump until success. "

    "\n",
    "A second significant problem is the readout contrast, which due to low collection efficiencies of current apparatus, is limited to a difference of a fraction of a photon between the ms = 0 and ±1 spin-projections. Consequently, a single qubit operation must be performed many times before sufficient shot-noise statistics are acquired to distinguish the spin-projections. This is a problem since occasionally the spin can decay non-radiatively, ending up in the other state. Tim mentioned some solutions to this. One obvious one is to use a cavity. **Try to remember other solution**\n",

    "> Imperfect knowledge of the ancilla state during or after readout dephases the qubits. To minimize this dephasing, we implement quantum non-demolition measurements of the ancilla by resonant optical excitation of $|0>$ and stopping the excitation within 2 µs upon photon detection (outcome $|0>$) to minimize spin flips in the optically excited state. The resulting readout fidelities are $F_0$ = 0.890(4) and $F_1$ = 0.988(2) (average: F = 0.939(2)). Crucially, the post-measurement fidelity after correctly assigning |0?a is 0.992, demonstrating the desired non-demolition character"

    "## Entanglement generation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to entangle the spin state of an NV centre with the photon number of a field mode. This is achieved by driving the spin conserving transition between $^3A$ and $^3E$ resonant with the ms = 0 level. As the ms = 0 excited state dynamics are dominated by radiative decay, with high probability (NUMBER), upon excitation the NV centre will produce a photon if it is in the ms = 0 state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This photon-number - spin-state entanglement is less useful than entanglement with the modal occupation of a single photon. This is because it is less resilient to noise (CHECK, maybe the Benjamin paper), and furthermore is sensitive to the precise optical phase picked up in progagation of the photon. Therefore the preferred approach of the Hanson group is to  entangle photon number with spin, flip the spin, and excite again - this produces a time-bin qubit encoded single photon entangled with the spin. Two time-bin photons from different NVs are then interfered to produce NV-NV entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Heralded entanglement between solid-state qubits separated by three metres (Hanson, Nature 2013)**, this was used to entangle two NVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unconditional quantum teleportation between distant solid-state quantum bits (Hanson, Science 2014)** used the same protocol. \n",
    "> Compared to the initial demonstration of this entangling protocol, we have further enhanced the efficiency of photon collection from our device through an antireflection coating. Also, we have improved both the spectral stability of the NV center’s optical transition and the charge state initialization by resonant re-pumping on the neutral-charge state zero-phonon line. As a result, the generation rate of the entangled is increased fivefold to 1/250 s−1 and the entangled state fidelity is improved from 0.73 to an estimated 0.87. \n",

    "#### ZPL and Cavities\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge facing entanglement generation protocols is that only 3-4% of the emitted photons are emitted in the ZPL. The rest of the photons are emitted in the vibronic sideband, and are in a mixed state due to unwanted entanglement with a phonon. This can be overcome by employing Purcell enhancement from a cavity. In essence, this enhances the coupling to one mode, ensuring that the photons produced is emitted into this mode. I need to read up on the theory of this a bit more, however, it is a well established technique. When I visited the group it sounded like they were getting close to having a cavity with a Q factor of 50,000. This was expected to produce a Purcell enhancement of x, and also directs more photons into the desired mode, leading to an increase in collection efficiency into fibre of x times. Since two photons are required in this protocol, two cavities would therefore allow for entanglement generation at X.\n"

A promising route is the use of weakly coupled nuclear spins (33–35) on which multi-qubit quantum control has very recently been demonstrated (36). For such nuclear spins, coherence times of >1 s under optical excitation have been reported (37), while the incorporation of NV centers into optical cavities may enable remote entanglement generation on millisecond time scales (38). \n",
