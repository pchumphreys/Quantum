## Summary 

This repository contains a few different useful bits of code for simulating various quantum systems, along with some notes I made when I first began working with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres.

### Contents
*[Background on NV centres](Background%20on%20NV%20centres) - these are some brief notes on the physics of NV centres, and their properties for quantum information processing
*[NV dynamics simulations](NV%20dynamics%20simulations) - simulations made to understand the dynamics of a single NV under optical excitation. Includes a quantum jump type code used to calculate two-photon excitation, as well as a more comprehensive classical dynamics code used to simulate transitions within the full manifold of states
*[NV-carbon coupling code](NV-carbon%20coupling%20code) - this module can run simulations of the nitrogen-vacancy centre spin state and its interactions with carbon 13 nuclear spins, along with, if desired, the nitrogen nuclear spin of the NV. Can include a range of potential imperfections.
*[Quantum optics](Quantum%20optics) - some useful bits of my older quantum optics code from when I was at Oxford.
